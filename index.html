            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a curious human being interested in Computer Science, Quantum Computing, Blockchain, and Artificial Intelligence. Born in China to a Danish father and Spanish mum, I grew up in a small town in northwest Spain. At 12, a life-changing event led me to spend a year in Australia with my brother and sister, where I mastered English and broadened my perspectives.</p>

            <h2>Studies</h2>
            <p>I began with two years of Mechanical Engineering at Universidad de la Coruña, excelling in theoretical subjects like physics, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, calculus, algebra, and statistics. Realizing my true passion, I pivoted to computer science, completing an intensive Web Development Bootcamp at IronHack. Currently, I'm pursuing a Computer Science Bachelor's Degree at University of the People while working full-time as a software engineer.</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>I've been working at Change The Block, a startup where I've become a key figure in development as I joined early on. I specialize in Web3 and Smart Contract development, as a self learner I become very commited to understanding the intrecates of blockchain, contributing as a teacher to educational Master's programs for Universidad Católica de Ávila and IEB online school's. My work also involved R&D&I projects combining sports, insurance, and blockchain technology.</p>
